Real-time neural network controlled creatures, implemented in Go.

##Status
This project is still in development and does not currently provide any useful function.

##Aims
We aim to create a general framework on which basic evolutionary creatures can be developed.

Basic creatures are generated with no knowledege or understanding and use basic evolutionary principles tied with neural networks to increase their own lifespans.

##Dependencies
goSDL is used to visulize creatures in their native habitat (your computer).

##Additional disclaimers
In the possibility that the basic creatures become intelligent enough to escape the confines of the simulation the developers would like to congratulate you on your discovery and will retreat to a safe distance.

##Related projects
