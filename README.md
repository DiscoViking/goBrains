#goBrains

Real-time neural network controlled creatures, implemented in Go.

##Status
This project is complete, barring feature additions.
The creatures are capable of learning to search for, and find food.

##Aims
We aim to create a general framework on which basic evolutionary creatures can be developed.

Basic creatures are generated with no knowledege or understanding and random brains.
No feedback is given, other than that creatures which live longer will have more chances to reproduce.
Over time, they evolve to be extremely efficient at finding and consuming food.

##Dependencies
goSDL is used to visulize creatures in their native habitat (your computer).

##Additional disclaimers
In the possibility that the basic creatures become intelligent enough to escape the confines of the simulation the developers would like to congratulate you on your discovery and will retreat to a safe distance.
